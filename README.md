# 100 Days of Code Challenge - Python Edition

This repository contains my solutions and projects for the 100 Days of Code challenge, specifically following Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" course on Udemy. Each day's work is organized into its own directory (Day-01, Day-02, etc.).

## About the Course

This challenge is based on Angela Yu's comprehensive Python bootcamp on Udemy.  The course covers a wide range of Python topics, from the basics to more advanced concepts, and includes numerous projects to build practical skills.  You can find the course here: [https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/]

## Disclaimer

These projects are the result of my learning journey through Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code course.  I have focused on understanding the underlying concepts and implementing them in my own way.  While I may have referred to the course materials for guidance, I have made every effort to create original code and the code in this repository is my own creation, and I believe it reflects my understanding of the topics.
